# ACE-Step Evaluation for BASED Music App

## üéØ Objective
Evaluate ACE-Step as a cost-effective alternative to ElevenLabs for BASED's music generation backend.

## üìä Current Cost Structure
- **ElevenLabs**: Premium API pricing killing margins at $2.99/song
- **Target**: Self-hosted solution for massive cost savings

## üî¨ Test Setup
- **Hardware**: M1 Max (32GB RAM) - CPU inference for quality evaluation
- **Model**: ACE-Step (stepfun-ai/ACE-Step) 
- **Test Duration**: 30-second clips (standard for BASED)
- **Inference**: CPU-only (for initial quality assessment)

## üéµ Test Cases
1. **Hip Hop/Trap**: Dark, heavy bass, aggressive rap vocals
2. **Lo-fi Chill**: Soft piano, ambient, peaceful female vocals  
3. **Electronic Dance**: Upbeat, energetic, club music with driving beat

## üìà Success Metrics
### Quality Assessment:
- [ ] Vocal clarity and intelligibility
- [ ] Music coherence and structure  
- [ ] Genre accuracy (matches prompt)
- [ ] Overall audio quality vs ElevenLabs

### Performance Metrics:
- **CPU Speed** (M1 Max): Expected 5-15 minutes per 30s track
- **GPU Speed** (RTX 4090): Expected 10-30 seconds per track
- **Quality**: Must be comparable to ElevenLabs for user satisfaction

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Current ElevenLabs:
- High per-generation cost
- Zero infrastructure management
- Instant results
- **Problem**: Killing profit margins

### ACE-Step Self-Hosted:
- **Server Cost**: ~$409/month (RTX 4090)
- **Break-even**: 138 songs/month ($2.99 each)
- **Capacity**: 1000s of songs/month easily
- **Per-song cost**: ~$0.04 (vs current high ElevenLabs cost)

### Profit Impact:
- **Current**: $2.99 - ElevenLabs_cost = low margin
- **With ACE-Step**: $2.99 - $0.04 = $2.95 profit per song
- **Margin improvement**: ~98%+ increase

## üöÄ Deployment Plan (If Quality Passes)

### Phase 1: Cloud Setup
1. **Provider**: Hetzner, RunPod, or similar GPU hosting
2. **Hardware**: RTX 4090 or RTX 6000 Ada
3. **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
4. **Dependencies**: PyTorch, CUDA, ACE-Step

### Phase 2: API Integration  
1. **API Wrapper**: FastAPI or Flask server
2. **Queue System**: Redis/Celery for background processing
3. **Storage**: S3-compatible for generated audio
4. **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics

### Phase 3: iOS App Integration
1. **Update SupabaseService.swift**: Point to new ACE-Step API
2. **Maintain same interface**: Keep existing user experience
3. **Fallback**: Keep ElevenLabs as backup if needed
4. **A/B Testing**: Gradual rollout to compare user satisfaction

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Server Specs:
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) or RTX 6000 Ada (48GB VRAM)
- **RAM**: 32GB+ system RAM
- **Storage**: 500GB+ NVMe SSD
- **Network**: High bandwidth for audio file transfers

### Software Stack:
- **Python 3.10+**
- **PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA**
- **ACE-Step pipeline**
- **FastAPI for REST API**
- **Redis for queue management**
- **Docker for containerization**

## üìã Decision Criteria

### ‚úÖ Proceed if:
- Audio quality is 80%+ of ElevenLabs quality
- Generation time under 60 seconds per 30s track (GPU)
- Setup complexity is manageable
- Cost savings justify the infrastructure effort

### ‚ùå Stop if:
- Audio quality is significantly worse than ElevenLabs
- Generation time is too slow for user experience
- Technical complexity too high for maintenance
- Users reject the quality difference

## üìù Next Steps After Evaluation
1. **Document quality findings** with audio samples
2. **Calculate precise cost savings** based on generation speed
3. **Create deployment architecture** if proceeding
4. **Plan gradual migration** strategy
5. **Set up monitoring and fallback** systems
